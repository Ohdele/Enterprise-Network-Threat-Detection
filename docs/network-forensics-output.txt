# Finding: A suspicious connection attempt from 192.168.10.20 to a high, non-standard port (44444) on 192.168.10.11 was captured. The packet analysis shows a TCP SYN (0x0002) followed by a RST, ACK (0x0014), confirming a connection refusal. This is an indicator of reconnaissance, beaconing, or anomalous lateral movement often flagged by intrusion detection systems.
